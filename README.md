Our team got selected for final round and we participated in the 24hrs 'CODE-A-THON' organized by Caterpillar Inc.

We developed a recommendation system, to predict the parts of a vehicle, based on user cart changes. The system will prioritize the user's choice for best recommendation by associating the parts usage.
The search will provide the recommendation parts, only when at least 4 parts are added to the cart.


To run the files 
1. Navigate to the directory in the cmd and locate the directory of the Home.py file.
2. Before runing make sure you have recommended pacages that are imported to the code and download all the pakagages.
3. Then in comand prompt run the file by using the below command
