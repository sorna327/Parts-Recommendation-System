Our team got selected for final round and we participated in the 24hrs 'CODE-A-THON' organized by Caterpillar Inc.

We developed a recommendation system, to predict the parts of a vehicle, based on user cart changes. The system will prioritize the user's choice for best recommendation by associating the parts usage.
The search will provide the recommendation parts, only when at least 4 parts are added to the cart.
